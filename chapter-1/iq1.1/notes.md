## Challenge

> Determine whether a string has all unique chars. What if you can not use additional data structures?

## Solution

- I can put all the chars in a set and then compare the length of the set with the length of the string. If they are equal, then
all the chars are unique.

## Lessons Learned

- I need to get familiar with basic operators of `String` class in Java.

- I need to learn how to instantiate basic data structures like set.

- Good idea is to explore the factory methods of the data structures, like `Set.of()`.

- But, beyond that, I think I should also learn how to initialize a set with a collection of elements.
